# Contributing to the gosdr project

As noted in the [README](README.md), this project is in its very early stages. However, that does not mean that there
are not opportunities for you to contribute to it. Here are some ways that you can contribute:

1. Write Documentation

Every project can use more documentation. Even though I intend to provide good documentation, that does not mean that you
cannot improve on the existing documentation or even provide more and better documentation.

2. Report Bugs

Report bugs in existing executables. Please be as explicit as possible, showing any output and reporting any error messages.

3. Try Other Dongle Types

I only have access to RTL-SDR v3 and v4 dongles. If you have other dongle types, try those. You will need to locate and install
the appropriate libraries for those dongles. Be sure to update the README.md and SBOM.md files to include information on 
those libraries.

If you find any bugs, either report them or try to fix them.

4. Port The Project To Other IDEs

I use Visual Studio Code because it is available on all of the OSes that I hope to support in the future. You can help by
porting the project to other IDEs, or by providing instructions to build the project at the command line. Be sure to provide
all required instructions for the IDEs and command line builds in the README.md file. If the README.md file becomes too
long because of a lengthy build section, consider moving the build instructions to a separate document called
*BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md*, and linking to it from README.md.

5. Port The Project To Linux And Windows

Be sure to update the README.md or BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md file with instructions for building the project on the newly
supported operating systems. Instructions for building on mulitple Linux distros are always welcome.

6. Review Project Code

As stated in the README, one of the goals of this project is for me to learn Go. It is always helpful to have someone review
any code to ensure that it is both correct and written in the Go way.
